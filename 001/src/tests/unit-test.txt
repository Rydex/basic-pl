	4 + (2 * 2)
	7 - (2 * (45 / 2))
	1 ^ (2 - 0)

vars testing:
	var a = 0, var b = 1, a + b
	var a = 23, var b = 21, a - b
	var a = var b = var c = 10 (should store number 10 in a, b, and c)
	var a = 2, a (should output 2)

errors testing:
	var a = 2, b = 0, a / b (should throw division by zero)
	var a = 2, b = 0, a % b (should throw mod by zero)
	var $$$ (should throw illegal char error)
	var a22222 (should throw invalid syntax)
